## Introduction

This repository and its content has been created for the training "Mobile DevOps". Its content is described below. The trainings take place all over Western Europe. 

**Please Note** This is a Fork of original repository, the content has been slightly customized and was used to run Training in Stockholm, Sweden on 2017-01-25 - 2017-01-26.
Note that the content of the repository will not be kept up to date after the training took place.

## Training Content

Agile mobile app development with Visual Studio, Xamarin & Microsoft Azure

### Introduction

Software engineering practices have changed drastically in the last few years. Agile practices, DevOps, Cloud Computing, Open Source and similar developments have proven their effectiveness. Microsoft’s platforms for software development and cloud computing have also embraced these concepts and are at the leading edge in their domain - also for cross platform mobile App development.

In this **two-day training** you will learn how mobile software development works with Microsoft’s tools and languages. Based on a consistent sample, you will learn how to

* setup a development environment for a mobile application with the latest versions of **Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team Services**,
* develop a simple **Android and Windows App with Xamarin**,
* benefit from the latest developments in the **Visual Studio C# IDE** (e.g. PerfTips, live code analysis, CodeLense, diagnostic tools, etc.),
* use **Visual Studio Team Services** to automate your build- and quality assurance processes,
* automate your tests using the **Xamarin Test Cloud** on over 2,000 real devices,
* automate deployment with **Visual Studio Release Management** and
* collect meaningful crash reports and feedback from your users in **HockeyApp**.

### Training Structure

The training is a combination of approx. 60% presentations with embedded demos and 40% hands-on time where you have your fingers on the keyboard and try what you have learned. Those who are new to the topics can follow a provided hands-on lab guide step by step. In areas you are already familiar with, you can put the guides to the side and create an individual sample with the latest tools and technologies.

Attendees should already have basic knowledge about Visual Studio, .NET and C#. Detailed knowledge about the latest versions of these tools, frameworks and languages is not required.
 
### Prerequisites

**You will need your own laptop to do the hands-on labs.** Ideally, you have the latest version of Visual Studio installed (detailed instructions about the necessary Visual Studio configuration will be provided) and you have access to your own Microsoft Azure subscription. If you do not have access to Visual Studio and/or a Microsoft Azure account, you can activate an Azure trial which includes 200 $ of free credit. This will enable you to run a VM with Visual Studio in it. In that case you just need internet access and a remote desktop client on your laptop. For the labs about build- and test-automation, you need your own Visual Studio Team Services and Xamarin Test Cloud subscription (free edition available).
