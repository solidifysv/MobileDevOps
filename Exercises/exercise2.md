## Learnings

1. Create Team Service account
1. Create Team Service Project
1. Import Code from GitHub into Project

## Create your Team Service account

1. Go to the offical [Visual Studio Team Service](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/team-services/) page and create an account for free. 
1. Login with your existing microsoft account or create a new one.
1. A name for your *VSTS* and additional information to your first project (created on account creation) have to be entered.

![VSTS_Create_Account](images/exercise2/VSTS_Create_Account.png "Create VSTS account")

After login there is an overview of your existing projects (should be only one after creating a new account). The navigation area is on the top left and there are four navigation points:

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Users](#users)
3. [Rooms](#rooms)
4. [Load Tests](#load_tests)

#### Overview
Dashboard with some overview information about your *VSTS* account.
* Your projects
* VSTS News
* Build and load testing statistics

![VSTS_Overview](images/exercise2/VSTS_Start_Page.png "Overview")

#### Users
User management of the *VSTS* account.
* List all users and their access level.
* Create and edit users and their access level.
* Export users as csv.

![VSTS_Users](images/exercise2/VSTS_Start_Users.png "Users")

#### Rooms
View of the team rooms management of the *VSTS* account. Team rooms are automatically created for each project to discuss issues and share the status.

![VSTS_Users](images/exercise2/VSTS_Start_Rooms.png "Users")

#### Load Tests
View of the load test management of the *VSTS* account. Create, edit and start cloud-based load testing for your web projects. 20.000 minutes each month are free. See [Getting started with Performance testing](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/test/performance-testing/getting-started/getting-started-with-performance-testing) for more information.

## Create Team Project in VSTS

Choose a project name and a description to specify your app. In our case, we choose **Hanselman.Forms**. There are three process template to choose:

1. Agile
2. CMMI
3. Scrum

Choose the process that fits best for your team (see [Guidance](https://www.visualstudio.com/it-it/docs/work/guidance/choose-process) for more information).
Finally choose a version control system, we use **Git**.

![VSTS_Create_Project_Progress](images/exercise2/CreateTeamProject-Progress.png "Progress of creating team project in VSTS")

## Import data from GitHub
In this example we use the code from an external GitHub repository, so we have to import this code. Click on **Code**, **Import repository** and add the following link: 
[https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Hanselman.Forms.git](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Hanselman.Forms.git);

![VSTS_Import_Code_From_GitHub](images/exercise2/Import_From_Git_Repo.png "Import code from GitHub-Repo")

The code should appear in the *VSTS* repo after the import completed. You can clone from the *VSTS* repo at any time.

## Connect Visual Studio to your VSTS repository
1. Open Visual Studio
1. Open the **Team Explorer** (View > Team Explorer)
1. Click on **Manage Connections > Connect to Team project**<br/>
   ![Connect to Team project](images/exercise2/vs-teamexplorer.png)
1. Add your VSTS<br/>
   ![Add the VSTS to Visual Studio](images/exercise2/vs-add-vsts.png)
1. Select the **Hanselman.Forms** project<br/>
   ![Select the project](images/exercise2/vs-select-project.png)
1. **Clone** the repository<br/>
   ![Select the project](images/exercise2/vs-clone.png)
1. Try to run the app in the Android Emulator (see [Exercise 1](exercise1.md) for trouble shooting)<br/>
   **Plan enough time for solving problems with Emulator, Xamarin, NuGet, etc.**   
   1. Set the Java Maximum Heap Size to **1G** for Debug and **Release** configurations.
   1. Update **Xamarin.Forms** NuGet package (if available)
   1. If you updated the **Xamarin.Forms** package, please commit und push your changes to your repository before continueing.

## Build Automation
1. Without changing any code we can configure our automated build with *VSTS*. 
1. Switch to the **BUILD** view. This view provides an overview of all build definitions and their current status.
1. Create a new build definition by clicking on the **NEW DEFINITION** button.
    ![Build_Start](images/exercise2/Build_Start.png "New build definition button")

1. In the opened dialog you can choose a predefined build template. The templates are grouped in two tabs: Build and Deployement. Choose **Build**
1. Choose the **Xamarin.Android** Build template.
    ![Build_New_Definition](images/exercise2/Build_New_Definition_From_Template.png "Create new build definition")
1. Click on **Next**
1. Choose the created repository of your *VSTS* and choose the master branch as default branch. 
1. Activate the option *Continous integration* to start the build whenever the selected branch is updated. 
1. Choose **Hosted** as your default agent queue. The hosted version has 240 build minutes for free. More information can be fround [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/admin/agents/hosted-pool). 
1. Click on the **Create** button to finish this step.

![Build_New_Definition](images/exercise2/Build_New_Definition_From_Template_2.png "Create new build definition")

You see two columns in your build definition settings: The build steps are listed in the left section, the settings of the selected build step are on the right side.

![Build_Edit_Build_Steps_1](images/exercise2/Build_Edit_Steps_1.png "Edit build definition")

1. Discuss the several steps in the build template
1. Disable the **Xamarin Test Cloud - Test** step: Select the step and deselect the **Enabled** checkbox in the **Control options** section. We'll add test automation later.</br>
   Note: The new build template automatically disables this step.
1. Disable the **Build solution \*\*/*test*.csproj** step.
1. Change the JDK options of the task **Build Xamarin.Android Project** to JDK 8.
   ![Build_Select_JDK](images/exercise2/Build_Select_JDK.png "Create new build definition")
1. Save the build definition and provide an appropriate name (i.e. Hanselman.Forms.Droid.Package).
1. Click on **Queue new build**, confirm the opened dialog without changing anything and watch the logging information.
