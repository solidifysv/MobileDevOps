# HockeyApp Integration - Build and User Feedback

## Learnings

1. [Register to HockeyApp](#register-to-hockeyApp)
1. [Connection between VSTS and HockeyApp](#connection-between-vsts-and-hockeyapp)
1. [Build integration](#build-integration)
1. [HockeyApp integration in project](#hockeyapp-integration-in-project)
1. [Release Management in VSTS](#release-management-in-vsts)

## Register to HockeyApp
1. Go to the [HockeyApp](https://www.hockeyapp.net/) page
1. Sign up for free (Button top right)
1. Enter your data
1. Select the **I'm a developer** checkbox
1. Click on the **Register** button to sign up.

![HockeyApp_SignUp](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_SignUp.png "Sign up to HockeyApp")

After signing up login to the created account to create a new app. In the first dialog choose **create the app manually instead**.<br/>

![HockeyApp_Create_App_1](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_Create_App.png "Create HockeyApp App")

1. Select the platform (*Android*),
1. the release type (*beta*),
1. the title (*Hanselman.Forms*) and
1. the bundle identifier (*com.refractored.hanselman* - see AndroidManifest.xml)

![HockeyApp_Create_App_2](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_Create_App_2.png "Create HockeyApp App - Settings")

Click on **Save** to create the app.

![HockeyApp_App_Created](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_App_Created.png "App Dashboard")

## Connection between VSTS and HockeyApp
1. Click on **Manage App** to go to the settings page.
2. Click on **Visual Studio Team Services**.
3. Click on **Configure**, enter your *VSTS* login infos and authorize the connection.

![HockeyApp_Attach_To_VSTS](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_Attach_To_VSTS.png "Connection between VSTS and HockeyApp")

Choose the correct *VSTS* project and check **Auto Create Ticket** on **Crash Groups** and **Feedback**.

![HockeyApp_Attach_To_VSTS](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_Attached_To_VSTS.png "Connection between VSTS and HockeyApp")

## Build integration
Next step is to integrate *HockeyApp* in the build automation process created in [**exercise 2**](exercise2.md). For build integration *VSTS* needs an api key of our *HockeyApp* account. Create this key in the **Account Settings** - **API Tokens** and copy it to the clipboard.

![HockeyApp_Api_Key](images/exercise5/HockeyApp_Api_Key.png "Created Api-Key in HockeyApp settings")

Install the **HockeyApp-Extension** from the **VSTS Marketplace.**

![VSTS_Marketplace_HockeyApp](images/exercise5/VSTS_Install_Hockey_app.png "Install HockeyApp-Extension from marketplace")

1. Open the created build definition and click on **Edit**.
1. Add new build step
1. Select the before installed **HockeyApp-Extension** (category "Deploy")
1. Click on close to add the selected task

![VSTS_Marketplace_HockeyApp](images/exercise5/VSTS_Build_Add_Hockey_App_Task.png "Add HockeyApp task to build definition")

The added task needs a **HockeyApp Connection**.
1. Click on **Manage**, right beside the **HockeyApp Connection** input
1. Add new service endpoint
1. Choose **HockeyApp**
1. Input the name = "Sample.Hanselman.Forms"
1. Paste the *Api-Key* from clipboard

![VSTS_Service_Endpoint_1](images/exercise5/VSTS_Build_Add_Hockey_App_Service_1.png "Add new Service Endpoint")

![VSTS_Service_Endpoint_2](images/exercise5/VSTS_Build_Add_Hockey_App_Service_2.png "Add new HockeyApp Connection")

Back to the build definition (after refreshing) the "Sample.Hanselman.Forms" connection should appear.
Set the **Binary File Path** to ``` $(build.binariesdirectory)/$(BuildConfiguration)/*.apk ```

Save the build definition and queue a new build. 
After build succeeded the apk-File should appear in *HockeyApp*.

## HockeyApp integration in project

### Crash Reporting
1. Add NuGet package to the Android project: [HockeySDK.Xamarin ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HockeySDK.Xamarin/)
![Integration_NuGet](images/exercise5/Integration_NuGet.png "Add HockeySDK.Xamarin")

1. Add code to Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs
```cs
[assembly: MetaData("net.hockeyapp.android.appIdentifier", Value = "YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_HOCKEY_APP")]
```

1. Add code to **MainActivity**
```cs
CrashManager.Register(this);
```

### User Metrics
User Metrics is not automatically gathered, you have to start this manually. Add following code to **MainActivity**:
```cs
using HockeyApp.Android.Metrics;

MetricsManager.Register(Application);
```

### Custom Events
**Please note**: To use custom events, please first make sure that User Metrics is set up correctly, e.g. you registered the MetricsManager:

```cs
HockeyApp.MetricsManager.TrackEvent("Custom Event");
```

### User feedback integration in project
This will add the ability for your users to provide feedback from right inside your app. For a quick demo we're calling the two methods right after startup - usually you would create a button or menu entry and execute it there.
**Please note**: The FeedbackManager.ShowFeedbackActivity(*) method is interactive and cant run in Xamarin Test Cloud. So it can only run in devices with end users. Comment it out before commit so your Xamarin Test Cloud works (just for exercise purpose, you need a condition to not run it in Xamarin Test Cloud).

```cs
FeedbackManager.Register(Application);
FeedbackManager.ShowFeedbackActivity(ApplicationContext);
```

## Release Management in VSTS
**Target:** Two independent environments, one for development and one for production. The development version should deploy automatically to *HockeyApp* and the production version should deploy automatically to *Google Play Store*.

### 1. Environment: HockeyApp
1. Go to release view in *VSTS*
1. Click on **New Definition**
![Release_Start](images/exercise5/Release_Start.png "First release definition")

1. Select empty definition
![Release_New_Definition](images/exercise5/Release_New_Definition_1.png "Create release definition")

1. Select build (Build with Tests, but without HockeyApp auto deployment), project: 'Hanselman.Forms' and build definition: 'Build'. If desired use *continuouse deployment*. Select the default *Hosted* agent queue and click on the **Create** button.
![Release_New_Definition](images/exercise5/Release_New_Definition_2.png "Create release definition")

1. Change name to 'Android'
1. Change name of first, auto generated environment to 'HockeyApp'
1. Add deployment task **HockeyApp**, add **HockeyApp Connection** and set **Binary File Path** to
```cs
build/**/*.apk
```
1. Go to Artifacts tab, change name of source alias to **build**
![Release_Created_First_Environment](images/exercise5/Release_HockeyApp_Task.png "Created first release environment")

1. Save and start new release to test current settings
![Release_First_Release](images/exercise5/Release_HockeyApp_Task_Success.png "First succeeded release build")

### 2. Environment: Google Play Store
1. Add a new environment
1. Select empty definition and choose a user from your project team in the pre-deployment approval. Activate the auto deployment trigger and select the default hosted queue.
![Release_Add_New_Environment](images/exercise5/Release_Add_New_Environment.png "Add new environment")

1. Change name of created environment to **Google Play Store**
1. Add new task and click on **Don't see what you need? Check out our Marketplace.** to get to the marketplace.
1. Search for **Google Play** and install the extension.
![Release_Google_Play_Marketplace](images/exercise5/Release_Google_Play_Marketplace.png "Install Google Play VSTS Extension")

1. After installation, select the new deploy task **Google Play - Release**, add it and close the dialog.
1. Add a new **Service Endpoint** for your **Google Play developer account** and select it.
![Release_Google_Play_Service_Endpoint](images/exercise5/Release_Google_Play_Service_Endpoint.png "Add new Google Play Connection")

1. Set **APK Path** to and click on save
    ```cs
    build/**/*.apk
    ```

Now the following **Release Management** and **Build** order is configured:

1. New code is checked in

1. Build-Task **Build & Test** started automatically

1. If build succeeded, release management starts **HockeyApp - Deployment** and new version can be tested

1. After testing, new version has to be approved

1. When all specified users have approved the new version, release management starts deployement to **Google Play store** automatically

1. New version is online and all users of the app can update or download the new version
